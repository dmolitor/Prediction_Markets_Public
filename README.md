Note: In March 2026 Kalshi updated their API endpoints, changing the way you search for and access historical data. I am working on methods to continue pulling historical data, please be patient. The current code will work to pull data before the historical cutoff (100 days is how Kalshi has it set currently).

## Overview

This replication package constructs the data from Kalshi used in *Diercks, Katz, Wright (2026)* using Python and R. It also creates a small website and GitHub Action that highlights the data and continually updates it over time.

To construct the dataset from scratch (downloading raw trade data from Kalshi and converting it into forecasts), the process takes approximately **1.5 hours**.

The website updates via a GitHub Action every Friday afternoon, pulling the most recent data, rerunning the methodology to generate forecasts, and updating the website with the latest results.

## Data Availability

All Kalshi data is pulled from their public API. Replicators will need to establish their own API credentials (stored as environment variables) to connect, but there is no private data involved. Permission from Kalshi to use the data for research purposes has been granted. Kalshi's data licensing agreement is included in this repository as `/API Developer Agreement.pdf`.

This package contains only the Kalshi data used in the paper. Fed Funds Futures and Bloomberg data were used as property of/licensed by the Federal Reserve Board and are not included. Survey of Primary Dealers data can be accessed publicly via the NY Fed. The replication archive is limited to work and figures involving Kalshi data only.

| Data file | Source | Notes | Provided |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| `data/trade_level_data` | Kalshi | Raw trade-level data | Yes (w/ code to generate updates) |
| `data/orderbook_data` | Kalshi | Raw orderbook data | Yes (w/ code to generate updates) |
| `data/daily_distribution_data` | Kalshi | Derived daily-frequency distributions | Yes (w/ code to generate from `trade_level_data`) |
| `data/daily_moments_data` | Kalshi | Derived daily-frequency moments | Yes (w/ code to generate from `trade_level_data`) |
| `data/daily_bid_ask_distribution_data` | Kalshi | Derived daily-frequency bid/ask distributions | Yes (w/ code to generate from `orderbook_data`) |
| `data/daily_bid_ask_moments_data` | Kalshi | Derived daily-frequency bid/ask moments | Yes (w/ code to generate from `orderbook_data`) |
| Bloomberg Economic Releases | Bloomberg | — | No |
| Bloomberg Consensus Forecasts | Bloomberg | — | No |
| Survey of Primary Dealers Forecasts | NY Fed | — | No |
| Federal Funds Rate Futures | CME | — | No |
| SOFR Rates | CME | — | No |

## Usage

The primary purposes of this package are:

1. **Transparency** about methodological decisions when extracting Kalshi-implied forecasts from raw data.
2. **A starting point for researchers** using prediction market data.

Following this package should provide a quick introduction to extracting Kalshi orderbook and trade-level data, converting raw data into market-implied probability distributions, and constructing moments from those distributions for analysis.

In *Diercks, Katz, Wright (2026)*, these moments and distributions are used for analysis — most auxiliary data and code for that analysis is **not** included in this public repository. Some light analysis documenting how to use the constructed data is included, as well as the code that generates the interactive data exploration website at [econfutures.com](https://econfutures.com), which updates continuously as new data arrives.

## Instructions for Replicators

1. Clone or download this repository and navigate to the root directory.

2. Create `env.env` file in the root directory with your Kalshi API credentials:
```
   KALSHI_KEYID=your_key_here
   KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```
   To obtain credentials, register at [Kalshi's developer portal](https://docs.kalshi.com/welcome).

3. Install Python (3.11) and R dependencies listed above.

4. **To download fresh data:** Run `python code/kalshi_scraping/scrape_kalshi_trades.py` from the
   repo root. This populates `data/trade_level_data` and `data/orderbook_data`. 
   **To use provided data:** Skip this step — the data is already included.
   
5. Run `Rscript code/convert_trades_to_pdfs/data_convert_runner.R` from the repo root to generate daily-frequency moments and distributions.
